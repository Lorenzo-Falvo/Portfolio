description: Game developed during my studies at DBGA (Digital Board Game Academy). It's an RTS game with auto-battler elements. The players will build their deck with their favourite units to battle for the control of the City of Tezuma in short 1v1 battles. The main objective of the game is to defeat the opponent by building an unstoppable formation with the best units and claim victory for yourself. Counterplay and strategic thinking will be greatly rewarded.

Role: Lead Game Programmer.
