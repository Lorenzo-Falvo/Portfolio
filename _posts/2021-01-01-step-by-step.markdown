description: Game developed during my studies at DBGA (Digital Board Game Academy). It's a crazy outrun-like wall-building simulator where you are a bricklayer but… you have no arms! You’re an alien stranded on an unknown planet. You must reach your spaceship before it leaves without you. The only way to reach it is by building a wall! You must use your legs to do everything!

Role: Game Programmer.
