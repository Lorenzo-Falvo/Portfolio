description: Game developed during my studies at DBGA (Digital Board Game Academy). It's a casual single-player mobile game in which the Player has to build and expand a village in a wood. In order to build and upgrade the Buildings, the Player has to gain Resources by playing a Memory Game. Each built Building produces a certain amount of Coins over time that needs to be spent in order to play the Memory Game.

Role: Lead Game Programmer.
